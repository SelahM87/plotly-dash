Dashboard Description:
I developed an interactive dashboard for analyzing Sephora skincare products using Dash and Plotly. The dashboard provides users with interactive features to explore various aspects of skincare products, such as attributes, brands, product types, and prices of different Sephora skincare products. Users of my dashboards can visualize the data through graphs like a sunburst chart, scatter plot, and bar graph, enabling them to derive meaningful marketing insights. 

Dashboard Building Process:

Data Collection and Preparation:
I started by collecting Sephora skincare product data and structured it using tidy data principles, ensuring cleanliness and organization. I also created a mock data frame using Canva to visualize and set goals for my final dashboard

UI/UX Design and Implementation:
